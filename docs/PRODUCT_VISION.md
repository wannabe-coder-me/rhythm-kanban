# Entrepreneur's Life System - Product Vision

## Overview

A life navigation system for entrepreneurs based on the philosophy that the subconscious mind, when properly programmed through repetition, emotion, and visualization, will attract opportunities and guide actions toward achieving one's dreams.

**Core Belief**: "What the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve."

## Philosophy & Principles

### The Four Types of People
1. **Droner** - Always complaining, drowning in problems
2. **Drifter** - "Whatever will be, will be" - no direction
3. **Surfer** - Enjoying life but going nowhere specific
4. **Navigator** - Has charts, maps, destination - this is our user

### The Iceberg Mind
- **Conscious Mind (10%)** - The "monkey mind", jumps from thought to thought
- **Subconscious Mind (90%)** - Doesn't judge, takes everything literally, controls automatic behaviors

### Programming the Subconscious
1. **Repetition** - Daily review of goals
2. **Emotion** - Feel it as if already achieved
3. **Visualization** - The mind can't tell imagination from reality
4. **Positive Language** - Mind doesn't understand "don't"

### The Formula
```
DREAM → BELIEVE → ACHIEVE
```

### Key Mantras
- "I want it because I want it" - no justification needed
- "Who must I become to achieve this?"
- "Abundance is not zero-sum"
- "We don't make money, we EARN it in proportion to value created"

### 4. Action System (Kanban Integration)

**Concept**: Existing Kanban boards become the action engine for achieving North Star goals.

**How Kanban Integrates**:
```
Life System
    └── North Star Goals (6 pillars)
        └── Linked to Kanban Tasks (optional)
    
Kanban Boards
    └── Existing boards remain (work projects, personal, etc.)
    └── Tasks can optionally link to a North Star
    └── Filter by pillar to see all related work
```

**Views**:
- **Today** - Actions for today across all pillars (pulls from linked tasks)
- **Pillar View** - All tasks linked to a specific pillar's North Star
- **Kanban** - Traditional board view (existing functionality)
- **Calendar** - Time-blocked actions (existing functionality)
- **Table** - Existing table view
- **Timeline** - Existing timeline view

**Task Enhancements**:
- Optional link to North Star goal
- Auto-tagged with pillar when linked
- Energy level (🔋 High/Medium/Low)
- Time estimate (minutes)

**Benefits of Integration**:
- Keep all existing Kanban functionality
- Work projects link to Career North Star
- Personal tasks link to relevant pillars
- See progress toward life goals through task completion
- "Today" view aggregates across all boards

### 5. Identity Tracker

**Concept**: "Who must I become?" is more powerful than "What must I do?"

**Components**:
- Identity statements per pillar
  - "I am a person who exercises daily"
  - "I am a generous giver"
  - "I am a present partner"
- Habit tracking aligned to identity
- "Proof" logging - evidence that supports identity

**Example**:
```
Identity: "I am a fit and healthy person"
Habits:
  ✅ Morning workout (streak: 23 days)
  ✅ 10K steps (streak: 45 days)
  ⬜ No sugar (streak: 3 days)
Proof:
  - Ran first 5K in 2 years
  - Down 10 lbs from January
  - Energy levels much higher
```
